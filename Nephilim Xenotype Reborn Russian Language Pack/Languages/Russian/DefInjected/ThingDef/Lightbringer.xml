  <!-- EN: A radiant sword forged to purge the wicked and the profane. Every slash of the mighty weapon that finds purchase in the body of abhorrent abominations or the psychically attuned finds itself cutting through effortlessly. This purpose does not come without downsides though, as when used against any other types of enemies, its edge seems to grow dull and its attacks prove far less effective. It is said that these swords were first forged by Nephilim in an effort to assert their righteous will, but with research and the proper rare resources, they may be possible to reproduce. -->
