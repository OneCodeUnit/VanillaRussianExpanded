	<!-- EN: A sophisticated device that infuses deathresting people with rare and potent sanguophage abilities, tapping into the very essence of their vampiric nature. Employing a complex system of blood conduits and essence resonators, the matrix connects to a deathrest casket and channels the life force of its occupant to unlock hidden potential within their bloodline. As the person slumbers in their deathrest state, the Invocation Matrix bestows upon them a selected, unique power. This building requires a constant supply of hemogen to operate. -->

	<!-- EN: An advanced device designed to expedite the deathrest process at the cost of blood consumption. By connecting with a deathresting person, this apparatus employs intricate blood analysis and potent sanguine stimulants to maximize the efficiency of the deathrest casket. As it hastens the character's recovery, the Hemodynamic Accelerator demands a continuous supply of hemogen to fuel its powerful operation. To function, it must be connected to a deathrest casket, ensuring the swift rejuvenation of its occupant. -->

	<!-- EN: A device specifically engineered to enhance the durability of deathresting characters by manipulating the molecular structure of their skin. Utilizing an array of bioresonant projectors and blood-based nano-agents, the solidifier targets the hemogen within the character's body, fortifying and thickening skin molecules. As the deathresting individual slumbers, the Hemogen Solidifier weaves a dense, protective layer around them, rendering their skin more resilient and damage-resistant. The device must be connected to a deathrest casket to operate, ensuring its occupant emerges from their rest with an augmented defensive capacity. -->
