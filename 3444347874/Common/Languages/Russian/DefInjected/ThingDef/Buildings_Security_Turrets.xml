  <!-- EN: A stationary arquebus mounted on a low castle wall to grant cover. Because of the added stability, the wall-mounted arquebus can fire much further than normal. The lead balls lose velocity and damage with distance, and are extremely ineffective against armor. Due to the chempowder reaction when firing the arquebus, plumes of blindsmoke are ejected from the barrel. -->
