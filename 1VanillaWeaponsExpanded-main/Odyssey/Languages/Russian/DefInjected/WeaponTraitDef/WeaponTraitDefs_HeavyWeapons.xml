  <VWE_WaterCooled.label>water-cooled</VWE_WaterCooled.label>
  <VWE_WaterCooled.description>This weapon is encased in a heavy, liquid-filled cooling jacket. It prevents overheating, allowing for much faster sustained fire, but drastically increases the weapon's weight.</VWE_WaterCooled.description>

  <VWE_Bipod.label>bipod</VWE_Bipod.label>
  <VWE_Bipod.description>This weapon features a heavy deployable bipod. It provides extreme stability and accuracy at long range, but the setup time nearly doubles the time it takes to aim.</VWE_Bipod.description>

  <VWE_SaturationFeed.label>saturation feed</VWE_SaturationFeed.label>
  <VWE_SaturationFeed.description>This weapon has a modified feed mechanism designed to put as much lead in the air as possible. It doubles the number of shots per burst, but the violent vibration reduces accuracy significantly.</VWE_SaturationFeed.description>

  <VWE_ShortStrokePiston.label>short-stroke piston</VWE_ShortStrokePiston.label>
  <VWE_ShortStrokePiston.description>This weapon uses a modified short-travel bolt carrier that strictly limits burst length. It fires half as many shots per volley, but the mechanism resets twice as fast, allowing for extremely responsive engagement.</VWE_ShortStrokePiston.description>
