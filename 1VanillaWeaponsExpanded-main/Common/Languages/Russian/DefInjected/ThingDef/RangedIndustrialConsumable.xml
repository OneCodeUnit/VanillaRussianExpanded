  <VWE_Gun_RocketLauncher.description>A single-use rocket launcher firing a massive, high-explosive warhead. Slow to aim with a significant minimum range due to its power, it excels against structures, mechanoids, and armored foes. Its unwieldiness, single-use nature, and sheer destruction make it a rare and scary sight in combat.</VWE_Gun_RocketLauncher.description>
