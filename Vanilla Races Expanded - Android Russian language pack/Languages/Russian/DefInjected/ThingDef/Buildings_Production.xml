	<!-- EN: A sizable device that features a pod equipped with numerous tissue probes and advanced neural scanners. Designed to accommodate one person at a time, the system requires four separate individuals to undergo scanning in sequence. Upon insertion, the polyanalyzer engages the probes and scanners to analyze the neuro-psychic patterns of each individual.
Utilizing a sophisticated algorithm, the device fuses these distinct patterns into a single, intricate persona after all four individuals have been scanned. This composite persona is then digitally transferred into a new composite-tier persona subcore. The process may cause temporary discomfort and disorientation for the participants but leaves them otherwise unharmed.
Persona subcores created by this device can only be used to create complex, human-like androids. -->
