	<!-- EN: A high-tier android brain designed as an intricate psychodynamic substrate unit, capable of supporting an advanced subpersona. This subcore is engineered to power complex and universal human-like androids. The subpersona contained within this core equals that of a live human in complexity, but is specifically programmed not to feel emotions and is confined within the core to prevent development into a fully-fledged AI.
To create such a sophisticated subcore, the composite patterns from multiple minds are integrated using advanced algorithms and precise analog transfers, without causing harm to the subjects. The Persona subcore stands as a testament to the fusion of human intellect and cutting-edge ultratechnology. -->
