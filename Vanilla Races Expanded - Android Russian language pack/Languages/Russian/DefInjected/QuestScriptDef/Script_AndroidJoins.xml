Once an android experiences high emotional trauma or happiness, it can develop sentience and personality.

If you accept, [asker_pronoun] will arrive immediately, but [asker_pronoun] will be followed by the search party that you will need to defeat.\n\nAndroids are synthetic, man-made constructs with metal bodies and neutroamine coursing through their veins. Operated by a persona subcore, androids are capable of all the same work kinds as humans, without the drawbacks usually associated with organic life.
