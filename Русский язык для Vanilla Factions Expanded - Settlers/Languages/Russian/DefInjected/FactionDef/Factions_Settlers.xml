  <SettlerSavage.label>bandits</SettlerSavage.label>
  <SettlerSavage.description>These people have lived here for decades or centuries, and have lost most of the technology that brought them to this world. They are a loose confederation of bandit gangs who've agreed to mostly fight outsiders instead of fighting each other.\n\nBandits don't sow, they don't build, and they rarely trade. Driven by a blood-and-honor culture that values personal strength and ruthlessness, they enrich themselves by raiding and robbing their more productive neighbors.</SettlerSavage.description>
