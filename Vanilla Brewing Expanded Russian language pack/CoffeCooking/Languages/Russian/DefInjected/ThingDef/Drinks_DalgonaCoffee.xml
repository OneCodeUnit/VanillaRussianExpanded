  <VBE_DalgonaCoffee.description>A trendy, newer drink in the world of coffee rumored to originate from far off steamworlds. Coffee granules are rapidly mixed with sugar to form a thick, luxuriously sweet foam. Afterwards the foam is dispersed over deeply chilled milk before drinking. Arguably the perfect drink to sip on while studying or reading.</VBE_DalgonaCoffee.description>
