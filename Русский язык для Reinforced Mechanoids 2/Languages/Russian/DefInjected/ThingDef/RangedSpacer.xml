  <!-- EN: A charged-shot burst-fire sidearm. Pulse-charge technology charges each shot with unstable energy as it leaves the barrel. Released on impact, the charged energy greatly increases the damage done.\n\nDesigned as a sidearm for infantry mechanoids with manipulators similar to human hands. The attached blade gives it superior melee viability. -->
