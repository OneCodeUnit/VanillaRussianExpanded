  <!-- EN: An incredibly powerful energy pulse artillery cannon. Fires a single, unstable projectile of pure energy at long range that explodes violently on impact. Very inaccurate as it is meant to hit large targets, while the explosion will ignite anything nearby and melt through starship-grade armour plating.\n\nAs the intended use is for sieges and planetary defences, the weapon cannot be aimed below a certain angle. -->
