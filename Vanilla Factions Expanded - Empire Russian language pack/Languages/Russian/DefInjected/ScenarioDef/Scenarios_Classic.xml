  <!-- EN: It was a long and quiet night when your entire life turned on its head. You are not sure if it was a deliberate sabotage by one of the family servants, a simple system malfunction or a well executed deserter strategy, but the mansion defense systems turned off as the clock struck midnight. When the gates swung wide, there was no time to call for aid - best you could do was hide.
  You heard the screams of your family and mansion workers as they were being slaughtered by the deserter strike team. You vowed to have your revenge, but until you make it out of this particular situation alive, your vows are all for nothing. You can either wait the raid out, use permits to call for reinforcements, or try running for the hills - the choice is yours. 
  Note: Since you start during a raid in progress, this is a difficult scenario.
