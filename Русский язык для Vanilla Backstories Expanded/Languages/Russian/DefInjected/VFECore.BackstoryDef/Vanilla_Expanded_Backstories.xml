    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] was the lucky owner of an olive tree plantation. [PAWN_pronoun] would spend hours tending the saplings, always telling [PAWN_possessive] family when they would laugh about it: never give up your last sapling, whatever happens, you can always start over. One day, [PAWN_pronoun] was found in a refugee group, staring blankly at his last possessions: a bloody picture and a small sapling. When it was time to go, [PAWN_pronoun] left the small olive tree behind.</baseDescription>

When the plague struck [PAWN_possessive] city, [PAWN_pronoun] was one of the few to survive and went nearly mad with grief as [PAWN_pronoun] saw how many had died. The city had to be abandoned, but a few years later travelers started to tell that it was now entirely covered in flowers, as if one flower sprouted for each and every victim of the plague.</baseDescription>

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] has been in one too many conflicts which has taken a toll on [PAWN_possessive] mind, as [PAWN_pronoun] still believes that the war never ended. As such, [PAWN_pronoun] is on a very tight hair-trigger and suffers from intense PTSD. Very few people could go toe-to-toe with [PAWN_objective] and any potential allies would do well to stay out of [PAWN_possessive] way and let [PAWN_objective] do what [PAWN_pronoun] does best: eliminate all threats.</baseDescription>

    <baseDescription>[PAWN_nameDef] served in [PAWN_possessive] government’s military with distinction, eventually rewarded with the rank of optio and would succeed in becoming a centurion once [PAWN_possessive] superior was promoted. In general, [PAWN_pronoun] was quite simple with these new responsibilities as the centurion ran a tight crew and rarely had to deal with insubordination, which resulted in [PAWN_nameDef] missing out on some key disciplinarian training.</baseDescription>

One can’t just throw anything together, but instead one has to carefully research the material and era- and culture-appropriate pieces that the outfit could be worn in. Particular care is taken into appropriate food, drink and mannerisms. At least, that’s what [PAWN_pronoun] says and it’s hard to argue with results, although that doesn’t stop some people from trying to kill [PAWN_objective] for making other enthusiasts look bad.</baseDescription>

However [PAWN_possessive] counter-argument is that it’s simply good business practice and the military should properly dispose of their own ordinance instead of relying on people like [PAWN_objective].</baseDescription>
