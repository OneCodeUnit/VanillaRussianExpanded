An experiment, a group of doctors wearing abstract masks, and a flash of golden yellow light enveloping your body. You feel something deeply unnatural pulsing in your chest, you have been modified somehow and have been sleeping for a very long time. Your legs shake as you remember what this place is, a near impenetrable fortress capable of keeping rescue out and captives in. The vault contains an underground section guarded by a sealed door. After so many years, your captives appear long gone. The cold realization thuds onto your chest, what unknown force may have placed you back here? -->
