  <!-- EN: story->This vault's patients guard the exterior, after they heard rumors of letting the monstrosities roam free. Afraid for their descendants, they staged an uprising to stop the entire operation. They took out several doctors then rushed to seal the massive underground vault door. After some deliberation, a group of patients decided to remain at the site. Choosing to give their lives to ensure their captors don't return to unleash the horrors onto the world was their way of keeping their families safe. -->

  <!-- EN: story->This vault contained a cult born from captivity. Through an experiment, a patient gained a powerful ability based around the external manipulation of the inner-self. He took it upon himself to thrust his ideology onto the other patients, until a unity of intention formed among the captives. They were to seize this site for themselves, and guard it as a beacon to their new leader. Executives heard this rumor, and chose to capture him. Strapped to machines, they numbed his synapses and attempted to remove his ability with experimental treatments. As the cult burst out of containment and stormed the halls, they were unaware of the state of their leader as they mercilessly took revenge on their captors. After escaping the underground vault, the members sealed the door and stood to guard their temple. It remains unclear whether the leader managed to escape, or became a monstrosity himself in their process of detainment. -->

  <!-- EN: story->Those who surround the vault guard a terrible secret. A patient was given the remarkable ability of telepathy through an experiment. The doctors were shocked as the man divulged specific details about their private lives. After being placed with the other patients, it is said the telepath began to disturb them with his accuracy. He began to unearth intimate details about their personal affairs, and the secrets they kept buried. Things changed when he looked at a disheveled patient for too long and heard a piece of information too dark to bear. The patients arranged to have the telepath killed, but executives intervened. The telepath used that opportunity to read the layout of the vault from one of the doctor's thoughts, and unseal the vault door. As he and a handful of other patients reached the surface, the disheveled man kicked the telepath back downstairs into the vault. Him and the other patients agreed to keep him sealed there forever, guarding their buried secrets with the horrors underneath. -->

  <!-- EN: story->This vault is guarded by a loyal group of friends. The underground halls once contained a gifted patient with the ability to manipulate her form. She could transform into anything on a whim. The doctors would bring out turtles and rabbits to test her skill, and through a painful melting process she was able to form a shell and become unmistakably a turtle. Overtime, this process became too grueling to tolerate. She was well-liked among the other patients, and they ended up taking great pity on her. On one night, they convinced the girl to melt into the form of a doctor to stage a breakout. She managed to bring all her friends to the vault door in her disguise, but was said to have instead accidentally unleashed a wave of the failed genetic horrors. The group of patients managed to escape, but the girl was left behind. Her friends now camp above the vault, hoping to one day rescue her from the depths. They speculate that the only way she could have survived is if she assumed the form of one of the monstrosities, forced to roam the halls masquerading as one of them. -->
