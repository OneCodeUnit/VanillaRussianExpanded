  <!-- EN: The ultratech heart of a gravship. The grav engine generates lift by inverting and intensifying the effect of gravity in a field around itself. This engine can lift upwards, but does not produce forward thrust. It can't function far from a large gravity well like a planet, so it is useless for interplanetary travel.\n\nWhen launched, anything on substructure that's connected to the grav engine will be transported to a new map.\n\nGlitterworld engineers use gravships to launch orbital platforms and build skyrippers. They require massive and hyper-specialized facilities to produce, making them a rare sight outside of glitterworlds. -->
