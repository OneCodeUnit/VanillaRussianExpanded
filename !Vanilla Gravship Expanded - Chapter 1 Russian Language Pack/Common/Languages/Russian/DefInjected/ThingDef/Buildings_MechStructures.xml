  <!-- EN: The cold, artificial heart of a mechanoid orbital platform. Unlike human-built grav engines, these are constructed by the mechanoid core itself, optimized for ruthless efficiency and unending operation. They generate immense lift and stabilization fields that allow entire platforms to remain suspended in orbit, forming the backbone of mechanoid dominance in space. While largely incompatible with human systems and not usable for gravship construction, they can be destroyed to yield a gravcore, a rare and valuable prize for any who dare to challenge them. -->
