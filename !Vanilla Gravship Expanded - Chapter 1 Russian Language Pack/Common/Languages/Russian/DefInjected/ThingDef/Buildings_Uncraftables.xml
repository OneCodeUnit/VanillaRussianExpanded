  <!-- EN: A low-grade subpersona specialized in gravship combat. It can link with a single gravship artillery piece and control it the same way a crewmember manning a targeting terminal can. It's combat capabilities are beyond that of even the best human gunner. A gravship can support up to two gunner subpersona cores. -->

  <!-- EN: A complex vertical launch and stabilization platform integrated into the gravship’s core structure. The gravlift provides the immense thrust required for vertical takeoff from planetary surfaces and stabilizes orbital insertion, allowing the gravship to remain suspended in space. It also softens the crash landing greatly, reducing the damage taken and ensuring substructure does not suffer critical damage. -->
