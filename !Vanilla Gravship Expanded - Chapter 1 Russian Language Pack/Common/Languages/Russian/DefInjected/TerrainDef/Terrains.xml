  <!-- EN: A warped and twisted section of gravship substructure. Once a solid truss with decking, it has been bent out of shape by heavy stress or impact. The grav engine’s levitation field still grips it, but its integrity is compromised: any further damage will cause this piece of substructure to collapse completely. -->
