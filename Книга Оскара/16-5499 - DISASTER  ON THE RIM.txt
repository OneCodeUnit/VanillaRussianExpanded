      5499 - DISASTER  ON THE RIM
      Beyond the reaches of civilized space, life is extremely chaotic and, 
oftentimes, similarly short. Events can happen seemingly at random and people's 
lives typically aren't worth the paper it's printed on. What look like random elements 
of chance typically have a long line of events that lead up to them, each of them 
having improbably low likelihoods of ever happening. But it is important to note that 
with forms of probability over a long enough period of time the likelihood of 
something happening eventually reaches one hundred percent. Such is the case that 
we'll be examining today, which involves the complete and utter destruction of a 
Cryptosleeper.
      First, we will observe the most obvious factors that could have caused such a 
case, as evidenced by the recovered ship black boxes. While military conflicts and 
pirate raids are usually the cause of ship attack or destruction, these risks are 
mitigated due to the refueling process of the Cryptosleeper as well as their low 
desirability as a civilian target. Once these ships enter the target system, they initiate 
a manoeuvre to orbit the local primary star to siphon hydrogen for their fuel cells 
which provide the majority of the power for long journeys. Thanks to the Von 
Neumann probes, practically no systems are left in local space that do not contain 
terraformed planets, which themselves need to be in the orbit of particular classes of 
stars primarily composed of hydrogen. While also charging the ship's batteries 
through massive solar panels, the close proximity to the star raises the hull's 
temperature and makes it difficult to detect by starship sensors which typically 
discern heat sources against the near absolute zero of space.
      Thanks to the knowledge gleaned by the aforementioned black box data, we 
know the ship experienced no external manmade complications. Instead, the ship 
experienced "turbulence" as it neared its approach to the target star in the form of 
micro-asteroids of considerable hardness, some of which managed to impact the 
ship's hull perpendicularly. The probability of these three factors happening at the 
same time is incredibly low, however large numbers of system redundancies and 
hardened plating reduced these risks to an acceptable level concerning opera-tional 
limits. One important thing to remember with engineering, design and safety factors 
is that some limitations will always be present as it is simply infeasible to prepare for 
every single eventuality with absolute certainty. A simplified example is that one 
spends more time and effort to mitigate something with a ten percent chance of 
happening compared to another event which has less than one percent.
      Once these foreign objects had penetrated various weak points of the hull 
plating, they went straight through until they encountered their next point of 
resistance which was at the opposite side of the ship. Naturally, on their way 
through, their small size managed to cause almost imperceptible damage that 
accumulated over the years of travel, which brings in the next safety factor. Shackled 
persona AIs are typically the easiest and most cost efficient way to manage a 
traveling ship through the long periods between stars but on particularly large ships, 
the organic staff are periodically woken up to perform minor checks and safety-
related maintenance. However, the rotas for these staff members are automated by 
the ship's mainframe before it engages the JT-Drive and certain limits are imposed 
on the AI during travel so it doesn't cause chaos such as minimum tolerances and 
safety overrides. The damage caused by the micro-asteroids were barely within the 
tolerance levels but enough to allow the AI to override its broadcast system, yet it 
decided not to do so quite possibly due to malicious compliance and a distaste of its 
personal situation for the past several centuries of forced operation.
      This brings us to another factor which led to the ship's destruction: the 
emergency broadcast system. While the ship has its JT-Drive engaged, the AI is 
responsible for operating the ship within certain parameters. However, once the ship 
is within a star system, the subpersona AI mainframe then takes over from the 
persona AI in general tasks as it wakes up the majority of staff, while the persona AI 
gets relegated to orbiting the local primary star at calculated distances. Part of this 
handshake requires removal of automated authority which is then handed over to the 
heads and chiefs of staff, with some automated safety systems remaining in place. 
However, the previous turbulence indirectly caused damage to one of those safety 
systems which could have otherwise prevented or at least mitigated disaster.
      Following this, we have an audio log between the Chief of Engineering and an 
assigned maintenance team - logged by the Mainframe as needing investigating - as 
they make their way to a chamber in the path of the space debris.
      
      *Audio Log - Chief Engineer Halsey - Excerpt*
      Chief Engineer Halsey: "Alright, you should be near the terminal now." 
      Maintenance Team Sierra One: "Roger, passing  through airlock." 
      Maintenance Team Sierra Seven: "Hey, can we eat before next time? Snack 
bars just ain't doing it for me." 
      CEH: "The faster this is done the sooner you can eat. You think I ate proper 
before I read the reports?" 
      MTS7: "I'm just sayin', that's why we have drones, right?" MTS1: "Huh that's 
weird... oh well whatever." 
      CEH: "What's weird?" 
      MTS1: "I could have sworn blind that airlocks took longer  to cycle."

      CEH: "Run a diagnostic once you're done with the terminal, keep moving." 
      MTS1: "I'm at the terminal, jacking in." 
      MTS7: "I'll look around, see if I can spot anything fishy." MTS7: "Hey buddy, 
do yo-" 
      MTS1: "I'm not your buddy, pal." 
      MTS7: "Well I ain't your pal, friend, but that still don't change there's air in 
here." 
      CEH: "What do you mean air, it's supposed to be sealed off." MTS7: "I'm 
telling ya, there's goddamn air in here, I ain't using my oxygen, the counter ain't 
going down." 
      MTS1: "They're correct, there's enough air that our recycler is-" CEH: "Find 
out where the hell the air is coming in and seal it, we're on final approach." 
      MTS7: "Got it chief!" 
      CEH: "And find out how the hell this has happened, the mainframe is saying 
it's still sealed." 
      CEH: "Talk to me, what's the hold up with the local diagnostic." 
      MTS1: "I'm running it again, it's throwing up stack  
      overflow messages." 
      CEH: "Who the fu- who is- what- I should kick your frakking ass, what do you 
mean overflow?! Do you think this is the time for jokes?!" 
      MTS1: "I'm serious Chief, the logs go back years and it's been trying to send 
out distress signals!" 
      CEH: "How the fu-"
      MTS7: "Chief we got a big goddamn problem here, punctures straight through 
the damn floor and the damn wires are burn-" 
      CEH: "Seal those bloody breaches right now and cycle the damn airlock, 
NOW." 
      CEH to Bridge: "Stop refueling and sound the alar-"

      The static and silence at the end of that log, as well as the following one, was 
caused by the leaking hydrogen mixing with the oxygen in the room that should have 
been vacuum-sealed and igniting through a spark from a frayed electrical wire. The 
next log is taken from an operating room. While cryptostasis is a largely safe 
procedure, some complications can occur during the many years of travel such as 
malignant or cancerous growths or harsher side effects of cryptosleep sickness that 
can be removed or treated with minimal complications.

      Dr. Scrivello: "WHAT? NO! Automation, stop!" 
      Computer: "Confirmed. Removal of sternum has begun."  Dr. Scrivello: 
"Christ, stop!" [Sounds of machinery crashing can be heard as an alarm starts to 
blare] 
      Computer: "All hands, evacuate ship." 
      Dr. Scrivello: "Shit, shit, SHIT. Computer, open the emergency pod. I hope 
wherever you land, they will have a decent surgical suite. Confirm patient has been 
loaded. Release the pod." 
      Computer: "Confirmed. Emergency pod has successfully disengaged."  
      Dr. Scrivello: "Good, time for me to get the hell out of-"

      As demonstrated, the Cryptosleeper has limited escape pods to be used in 
emergency situations, however they are mostly reserved for staff in the event that 
they cannot reach their cryptopod in time. They are largely considered unnecessary 
because the cryptosleep caskets work perfectly fine as a quasi-escape pod in the 
vacuum of space and if there was ever a critical event staff are expected to return to 
their caskets so that all of the passengers remain together, increasing their chance 
of rescue. Indeed, large sections of the ship's passenger ring were recovered while 
conversely very few of the escape pods were found which will be explained in the 
upcoming data log from the mainframe black box.
      Many escape pods that successfully launched were given courses to intercept 
the closest inhabitable world; in this case a rimworld. Others were unable to adjust 
their courses in time and passed the nearby star too closely, turning into molten slag 
by the time it escaped orbit. Most of the resulting hunks of metal were captured by 
nearby stellar objects - including said rimworld - while others are still unaccounted 
for, possibly picked up by opportunistic scavengers. Before finishing with the final 
log, it is important to note how rare an event this  actually was. However, the study of 
disasters of this magnitude are beneficial in creating future improvements to 
Cryptosleepers. It is also important to keep things in perspective: a person is more 
likely to die climbing out of their own bed or getting crushed by a vending machine 
than they are to experience an accident while traveling to the Rim.
