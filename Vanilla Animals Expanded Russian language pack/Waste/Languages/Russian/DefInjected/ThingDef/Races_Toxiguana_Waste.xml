	<!-- EN: The Toxiguana is a small, two-legged lizard that is well adapted to highly polluted environments. Standing about the size of a dog, this creature is not to be underestimated. It has a formidable defense mechanism, capable of spitting corrosive acid at any predator that threatens it. When it dies, a chemical reaction causes its body to rapidly decompose, releasing a toxic cloud of gas that can be dangerous to any living thing that comes into contact with it. The Toxiguana is a remarkable example of the resilience of life in even the harshest of environments. -->
