	<!-- EN: The Megatardi is a massive and curious creature, mutated from its tiny tardigrade origins to become a behemoth of the wasteland. Though slow and blind, it requires very little sustenance to survive and can consume even the most toxic wastepacks. With its six legs, the Megatardi is an impressive sight, and its gentle nature makes it a popular pack animal among those brave enough to venture into the polluted world. Though it is easily tamed, the Megatardi is not without its dangers. Upon its death, it releases a cloud of toxic gas, making it a potential hazard for anyone nearby. Despite this, the Megatardi remains a valuable asset for those willing to take on the challenges of the polluted wasteland. -->
