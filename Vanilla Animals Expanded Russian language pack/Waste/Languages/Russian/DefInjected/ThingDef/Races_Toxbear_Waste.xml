With no natural predators, it roams and hunts at will, leaving destruction in its wake. Its aggressive behavior is fueled by cancerous growth around its head, making it nearly impervious to damage.\n\nAs the growth puts pressure on its brain, the Toxbear becomes increasingly violent, eventually turning completely rabid. Not long after that, toxbears are known to try and scratch their own brains out, resulting in their violent demise. -->
