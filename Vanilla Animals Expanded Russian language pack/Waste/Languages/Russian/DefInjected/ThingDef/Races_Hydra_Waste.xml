	<!-- EN: The Hydra is a fearsome creature, mutated by the toxic environment to become a three-headed snake. Living primarily in water, two of its heads remain submerged while only one absorbs oxygen. Quick and vicious in its attacks, the Hydra's bite is lethal, delivering a potent venom with each strike. Its ability to adapt to even the harshest of environments makes it a formidable predator, and one that should be approached with caution. The Hydra's three heads are a symbol of its adaptability and resilience, making it a force to be reckoned with in the polluted biomes. -->
