	<!-- EN: The Toxscorpion is a massive and fearsome creature, growing as large as a cow. Its thick carapace and powerful claws make it nearly invulnerable, capable of cutting through even metal. With no definite weak spot, the Toxscorpion is a formidable opponent. Mutated from exposure to radiation and toxins, its stinger injects a fast-acting poison that alters the DNA of its victims. This leads to toxic buildup and cancerous growths that must be swiftly removed before they spread, making the Toxscorpion one of the most dangerous creatures in the wasteland. -->
