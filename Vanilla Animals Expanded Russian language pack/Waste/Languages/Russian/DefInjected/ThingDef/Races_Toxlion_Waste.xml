	<!-- EN: The toxlion is a sad reflection of what once was a proud and powerful predator. Its toxic environment has left it weak and emaciated, forcing it to survive by feeding on waste. Despite its diminished state, the Toxlion is still a threat. Its bites and claws have a high chance of spreading the toxflu, and it hunts in large packs to make up for its lack of strength and speed.\n\nToxflu is a highly contagious and rapidly striking disease, characterized by fever, cough, fatigue, and difficulty breathing. It spreads quickly through contact with infected bodily fluids. Those who contract Toxflu can experience severe respiratory distress and, in severe cases, death. It goes away nearly as quickly as it appears, however anyone who interacted socially with a person suffering from toxflu has a chance of catching it. -->
