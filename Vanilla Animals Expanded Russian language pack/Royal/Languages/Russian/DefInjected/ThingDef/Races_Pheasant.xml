  <VAERoy_Pheasant.description>Small, noble poultry that was genetically engineered to be an excellent small game animal. When pheasants run away from danger, they emit a psychic invisibility blast, making their allies hidden from sight.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt; Whenever a pheasant is in danger (it starts fleeing), it emits a psychic shockwave in radius of 6 cells around itself. It only does it once every 24 hours. This shockwave gives all pawns under player control in that radius Psychic Invisibility for a short period of time, making them untargetable by enemies.</VAERoy_Pheasant.description>
