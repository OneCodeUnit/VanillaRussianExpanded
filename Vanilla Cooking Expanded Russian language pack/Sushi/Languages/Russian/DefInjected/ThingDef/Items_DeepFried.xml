  <VCE_DeepFriedSushi.description>Sushi is one of the healthiest foods about. So sooner or later someone was going to deep fry it and make it the opposite. The end result is a crunchy, unhealthy yet tasty soul food - Not quite as filling as a meal, but very pleasing to eat. Deep frying sushi reduces shelf life as well unless frozen.</VCE_DeepFriedSushi.description>
