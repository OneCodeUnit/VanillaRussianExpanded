						<description>A thick, tall, tropical grass with jointed stems. The Uba variety is much hardier but less productive than common sugarcane. While not exactly the most nutritious thing to eat on its own, this genetically modified sugarcane is easily milled into brown sugar and then used for a variety of culinary creations - Particularly desserts.</description>

						<description>Brown sugar is a sucrose sugar product with a distinctive brown color due to the presence of sugarcane molasses, and it adds a much desired sweetness. Sugar is easily converted into energy by the body, which may result in a nice burst of energy.</description>

						<description>Spelt is a species of wheat that has been cultivated since approximately 5000 BC. A good source of dietary fiber, protein (which it contains more of than common wheat), and vitamins and minerals. Spelt takes almost an entire growing season to come to fruition. While fragile and time-consuming, this cereal has been genetically engineered to gently break into flour with a mere touch.</description>

						<description>Spelt flour, ideal for use in baking. Spelt flour takes a very long time to go bad, if stored in a dry environment. It was produced by spelt that has been genetically engineered to gently break into flour with a mere touch.</description>
